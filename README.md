# X-ray Pneumonia Classification Web App with TensorFlow and Streamlit

![Thumbnail](wr.png)

A web application for classifying chest X-ray images to detect signs of pneumonia using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow and deployed via Streamlit.

## 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates a deep learning-based web app that accepts chest X-ray images and predicts whether pneumonia is present or not. It aims to simplify the pneumonia detection process using medical imaging and modern machine learning tools.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload chest X-ray images and receive instant predictions
- Built using TensorFlow and Streamlit
- Trained on labeled X-ray data for binary classification: Pneumonia or Normal
- Deployed using ngrok for live testing
- Responsive and user-friendly interface

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- TensorFlow / Keras (Model development)
- Streamlit (Web interface)
- Python
- ngrok (For temporary web deployment)

## 🖼️ Model Performance

- Achieved over **90% accuracy** on validation data
- Custom CNN trained on publicly available pneumonia datasets

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
